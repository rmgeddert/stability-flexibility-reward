        <p><b>Title of research study:</b> Number Classification Task</p>
        <p><b>Key Information</b></p>
        <p>This research study is conducted by Dr. Tobias Egner at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University. Its purpose is to examine the ease with which people switch between tasks and how they respond to varying task demands.
        </p>

        <p><b>Purpose:</b> In this experiment, you will be asked to categorize different visual stimuli according to one or more task rules. For example, you may be asked to categorize numbers as odd or even or as greater or less than 5. Sometimes, the task rule switches between trials, and sometimes it stays the same. You may also be asked to choose the task you want to perform. The entire experiment is expected to take 30 minutes.</p>

        <p><b>Risks & Benefits:</b> We know of no risks or benefits to you for participating in this research study. The potential benefits of this research lie in the knowledge that will be acquired.</p>

        <p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Our records will include the demographic information that you report (age, gender, etc.) as well as your task performance data and questionnaire responses. We employ a participant code system to ensure that this information is not directly linked to your name or consent form. The consent, demographic, and the de-identified performance and questionnaire data will be stored in a locked laboratory space or placed on our secure computer network, both of which can only be accessed by trained study personnel. All data will be kept for at least six years or as long as is required by Duke University or any journal that may publish these findings. Your data, with direct identifiers removed, may be used for future studies and/or shared with other researchers. If a report of this study is published or presented, only group results will be reported. </p>

        <p><b>Compensation & Participation:</b> For participating in this study, you will earn 0.5 course credits. Your participation is voluntary. You can discontinue participation at any time for any reason by closing your internet browser window.</p>

        <p><b>Contact information:</b> If you have additional questions regarding this study or your data, you may contact Professor Tobias Egner at (+1) 919-684-1049 or tobias.egner@duke.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Human Subjects Protection at campusirb@duke.edu. Please reference protocol ID# 2022-0079.</p>
